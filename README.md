# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I am Fabricio Pashaj, a 16 year old coding addict. I started to learn HTML by the middle of February, 2020. My favourite editor is Vim (just Vim, without the `N` at the begining).

## Stuff about me

- I code on an android phone ðŸ“±.
- I don't like GUIs.
- I don't write cross-platform C code unless I have or someone asks me to.
- I use gruvbox theme.
- I like math, physics, biology and chemistry.
- I like reading books but I hate literature classes.
- Elon Musk is cool.
- I like anime and manga but just as an enjoyer.
- I like high bass music, LabÃ«ri (south Albania) Poliphony and some classical music.
- INTp personality type.

## Experiences

### Actively used languages and tools.

- C<br />
  Yes, I'm a C programmer, yes I love low level and native, and yes I like to manage memory myself. I believe a library should never use hardcoded memory management functionsâ€”_ahem_ malloc _ahem_ free _ahem_â€”but instead it should use what the user tells it to. BTW I love macros and I unit-test my C projects.
- CUnit<br />
  Unit testing library for C.
- Makefile<br />
  What C programmer I would be if I didn't know how to use make? I may not be an expert but I have the sufficient knowledge needed to write a working Makefile.
- Git<br />
  Who doesn't?
- find & grep<br />
  To find stuff in a haystack of files contained in nested directories.
- C++<br />
  Only during winter for CS olympiads.

### Learning

- Rust<br />
  You may call me a freak, but C feels much easier to use.
- ARM Assembly<br />
  Know how to read most instructions.
- VimScript<br />
  Looks like esolang lol.
- Lua

### Not actively used languages and tools.

- HTML5<br />
  I know how to use it but I'm still not very good, haven't used it in months.
- CSS<br />
  I only remember some stuff, because, like HTML ^...
- JavaScript<br />
  Mostly NodeJS and a little in-browser. I never write it by hand anymore except for tests.
- TypeScript<br />
  I'd say I know it on an intermediate level.
- AssemblyScript<br />
  The language I feel the most comfortable with when compiling to WASM.
<!-- - V(lang)<br />
  Quit because of trash community. -->
- Java (android dev)<br />
  Made an app once. It had bugs and was dropped because I didn't know how to do debugging at the time.
- SpaceX rockets are cool<br />
  I know how to use them, but I can't find a use case for them.
- Python<br />
  I have actively used it before for a variety of things, now I just use it for scripts.
- Bash<br />
  .bashrc and other small scripts.
- WebAssembly-Text (WAT)<br />
- WeeChat<br />
  Still haven't used that once.
- CMake<br />
  I don't use it per se, I just need it to build other projects.

## Interests (preferably C-based)

- Parsers
- Virtual Machines (the bytecode ones)
- Compilers
- JIT Compilers
- CLI apps
- CLI games

BTW if you are interested in anything relating to the first 4, you can join me and my friends with similiar interests in the [Homebrew Compiler Club](https://discord.gg/V9S8vyWQ) discord server.
