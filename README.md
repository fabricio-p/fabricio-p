# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
I am Fabricio Pashaj. I'm 16 year old and I'm a coding addict. I started to learn HTML by the middle of February, 2020.My favourite editor is Vim (just Vim, without the `N` at the begining).

## Experiences
### Not actively used languages and tools.
  - HTML5<br />
    I know how to use it but not very good, haven't used it in months.
  - CSS<br />
    I remember onky some stuff, because, like HTML ^...
  - JavaScript<br />
    Mostly NodeJS and a little in browser. I never write it by hand anymore except for tests.
  - TypeScript<br />
    I'd say I know it on an intermediate level.
  - AssemblyScript<br />
    The language I feel the most comfortable with when compiling to WASM.
  - V(lang)<br />
    Quit because of trash community.
  - Java (android dev)<br />
    Did an app once, it had bugs, dropped because I didn't know how to do debugging at the time.
  - Elixir & Erlang<br />
    I know how to use them, but I can't find a use case for them.
  - Python<br />
    I have actively used it before for different stuff, now I just use it for scripts.
  - Bash<br />
    .bashrc and other small scripts.
  - WebAssembly-Text (WAT)<br />
  - WeeChat<br />
    Still haven't used that once.
  - CMake<br />
    I don't use, I just need it to build other projects.
### Actively used languages and tools.
  - C<br />
    Yes, I'm a C programmer, yes I love low level and native, yes I like to manage memory by myself and I believe a library should never use hardcoded memory management functions (*ahem* malloc *ahem* free *ahem*), but instead it should use what the user tells it to. BTW I love macros and I unit-test my C projects.
  - CUnit<br />
    Unit testing library for C.
  - Makefile<br />
    What C programmer I would be if I didn't know how to use make. I may not be an expert but I have the sufficient knowledge needed to write a working one.
  - Git<br />
    Who doesn't.
  - find & grep<br />
    To find stuff in a lot of files in nested directories.
  - C++<br />
    Only during winter because of CS olympiads.

## Learning
  - Rust<br />
    You may call me a freak, but C feels much easier to use.
  - ARM Assembly<br />
    Know how to read most of instructions.
  - VimScript<br />
    Looks like esolang lol.
  - Lua

## Interests (prefferably C)
  - Parsers
  - Virtual Machines (the bytecode ones)
  - Compilers
  - JIT Compilers
  - CLI apps
  - CLI games

BTW if you are interested on the first 4 ones ^, you can join me and my friends with similiar interests in the [Homebrew Compiler Club](https://discord.gg/V9S8vyWQ) discord server.
