<!-- # Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I am Fabricio Pashaj, a 16 year old coding addict. I started to learn HTML by the middle of February, 2020. My favourite and current editor is NeoVim.

## Stuff about me

 - Gruvbox theme.
 - I like math, physics, biology and chemistry.
 - I like reading books but I hate most of school.
 - Rockets, rocket science and other scientific topics are really **cool**.
 
## Experiences

### Actively used languages and tools.

 - C<br />
   Yes, I'm a C programmer, yes I love low level and native, and yes I like to manage memory myself. I believe a library should never use hardcoded memory management functionsâ€”_ahem_ malloc _ahem_ free _ahem_â€”but instead it should use what the user tells it to. BTW I love macros and I unit-test my C projects.
 - CUnit<br />
   Unit testing library for C.
 - Makefile<br />
   What C programmer I would be if I didn't know how to use `make`? I may not be a Makefile wizard but I have the sufficient knowledge needed to write a decent working Makefile.
 - Git<br />
   Who doesn't?
 - find & grep<br />
   To find stuff in a haystack of files contained in nested directories.
 - C++<br />
   Only during winter for CS olympiads.
 
### Learning

 - Rust<br />
   It actually isn't thst hard but I just can't get used to it.
 - ARM Assembly<br />
   Intermediate knowledge.
 - Lua
   Becoz NeoVim.
 
### Not actively used languages and tools.

 - HTML5<br />
   I know how to use it but I'm not very good at it, haven't used it in months.
 - CSS<br />
   I only remember some stuff, because, like HTML ^...
 - JavaScript<br />
   Mostly NodeJS and a little in-browser. I never write it by hand anymore except for tests.
 - TypeScript<br />
   I'd say I know it on an intermediate level.
 - AssemblyScript<br />
   The language I feel the most comfortable with when compiling to WASM.
 - Java (android dev)<br />
   Made an app once. It had bugs and the project was dropped because I didn't know how to do debugging at the time.
 - Python
   I have actively used it before for a variety of things, now I just use it for scripts.
 - Erlang & Elixir<br />
   I know how to use them but barely found any use case.
 - Bash<br />
   .bashrc and other small scripts.
 - WebAssembly-Text (WAT)<br />
 - WeeChat<br />
   Still haven't used that once.
 - CMake<br />
   I don't use it, I just need it to build other projects that do.
 
## Interests (preferably C-based)

 - Parsers
 - Virtual Machines (the bytecode ones)
 - Compilers
 - JIT Compilers
 - CLI apps
 - CLI games
 
BTW if you are interested in anything relating to the first 4, you can join me and my friends with similiar interests in the [Homebrew Compiler Club](https://discord.gg/V9S8vyWQ) discord server.
